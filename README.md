This is a class implemenation for a Binet Function class.

It contains:

   binet.h -> Binet class prototype <br />
   binet.cpp -> Binet class implementation<br />
   main.cpp -> testing the class<br />
   main.x -> executable<br />

I created this in order to mimic the Binet Formula, a formula that can find the
nth fibonacci number.  I was planning on using this to complete various Project Euler problems in a timely manner.
